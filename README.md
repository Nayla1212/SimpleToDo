GIF created with QuickTime Player (Kap kept crashing and issue could not be resolved in time).

## Notes

I came across several challenges that all had to do with simple attention to detail. Several pre-configured settings within my code were diffferent from the tutorials, so it took me a while to figure out what was different in my preset code versus what I saw in the video. Then, when recording my project, Kap kept crashing on me so I was unable to use it to create a .gif file. Instead, I used QuickTime Player since it was already installed on my Mac and created a .mov walkthrough. I was unable to view the file when I converted it to a .gif, so I decided to keep it as a .mov. 

Project 0 provided a great learning experience and helped me understand the platforms we will be using throughout the summer. There were a few hiccups here and there, but with time I hope to learn from these mistakes.
